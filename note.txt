WHAT IAM LEARNING IN 40 MINUTES OF GIT:
1. Discover a three tree of git or you can say it fundamental of git
2. A condition each phase of file
3. A diagram of git works (just a basic to known).
4. What is git?
5. Local repo/remote
6. Basic command to use git

PROBLEM THAT I WAS FOUND:
1. Need more understanding of condition phase of file -> staging, modified, commited
2. Need more explanation of the tree git. or i could say i just confused what is tree git or fundamental git, is both are different meaning?
3. Need to know how to undoing changes or commit especially `git reset` command, still confused how to use it. 
4. About HEAD?
